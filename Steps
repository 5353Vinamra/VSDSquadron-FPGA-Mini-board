# Steps:

##Study the Existing Code:
Access the uart_loopback project from the VSDSquadron_FM repository.
Analyze the Verilog code to understand the loopback logic.

---

##Design Documentation:
Create a block diagram illustrating the UART loopback architecture.
Develop a detailed circuit diagram showing connections between the FPGA and any peripheral devices used.

---

##Implementation:
Set up the hardware as per the circuit diagram.
Synthesize and upload the Verilog code to the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini.

---

##Testing and Verification:
Use a serial terminal to send data to the FPGA and verify that the same data is received back, confirming successful loopback.

---

##Documentation:
Compile the block diagram, circuit diagram, code explanations, and testing results into a comprehensive report.
Record a short video demonstrating the loopback functionality in action.
