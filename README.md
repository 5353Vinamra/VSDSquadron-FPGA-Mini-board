## üöÄ About the Project

This repository contains RTL designs, simulations, and programming tasks performed on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board. The goal is to explore digital design concepts and gain hands-on experience with FPGA development using both proprietary and open-source EDA tools.

### ‚úÖ Current Focus
- Understanding the VSDSquadron FPGA architecture
- Implementing basic logic circuits
- Performing simulations and verifying functionality
- Flashing designs onto the FPGA board
