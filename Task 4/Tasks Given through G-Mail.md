# UART TX Sense Module Analysis

The `uart_tx_sense` module is a Verilog-based design that handles the task of reading sensor data and transmitting it over a UART line. It's built to work efficiently with sensor systems where continuous or triggered data transmission is needed.

## Overview

The module starts by receiving **32-bit wide sensor data** through the `data` input line. This data becomes valid when the `valid` signal goes high. Internally, the module captures this data and holds it in a buffer. Transmission only begins when the module is in an **idle** state and the data is marked as **valid**.

## UART Transmission

A UART transmission protocol is used for communication. This involves sending:
- a **Start Bit** (logic low),
- followed by **8 bits of actual data**,
- and ending with a **Stop Bit** (logic high).

This process is repeated until the entire 32-bit sensor reading is transmittedâ€”most likely broken into four 8-bit segments.

## Finite State Machine (FSM)

An internal FSM (Finite State Machine) manages:
- The sequencing of **start**, **data**, and **stop** bits
- Ensuring proper timing with respect to the **UART baud rate**
- Synchronization of data capture and transmission

## Ports and Signals

- `clk`: Main clock signal for synchronous operations
- `reset_n`: Active-low asynchronous reset
- `data[31:0]`: Input for sensor data
- `valid`: Input handshake signal indicating valid data
- `ready`: Output indicating readiness to accept new data
- `tx_out`: UART-compliant serial output signal

## Functionality Summary

- Captures and stores sensor data on valid signal
- Sends data over UART in a byte-wise fashion
- Uses internal FSM for reliable, protocol-compliant transmission
- Provides status through `ready` signal and serial output through `tx_out`

This design ensures clean separation between data acquisition and transmission, allowing **reliable and consistent UART output** of sensor data.
